# MtRBD: Advancing iRBD Analysis with Multi-Task Learning for Joint Sleep Staging and RSWA Detection

## 1. Background

The **MtRBD (Multi-task REM Sleep Behavior Disorder)** model is designed to address a critical challenge in sleep disorder research: simultaneously performing **sleep staging** and **RSWA (REM Sleep Without Atonia)** detection. 


## 2. Model Overview

The **MtRBD model** is built upon the backbone network **MIABNet** (Multi-scale Information Attention Bottleneck Network), which effectively fuses multi-channel PSG signals across temporal scales. The **MtRBD** model enhances this architecture by incorporating a **Multi-task Learning (MTL)** framework, enabling joint optimization of both sleep staging and RSWA detection tasks. In addition to **MIABNet**, the model utilizes **Dynamic Feature Enhancement Modules (DFEM)**.



## 3. Model Parameter Ablation and Selection Validation

We have conducted comprehensive experiments on model parameter ablation and selection to validate the impact of each component. These experiments are included in the supplementary materials for further details. You can refer to our **supplementary materials** document, **MtRBD_supplementary_materials.pdf**, for the full analysis of these experiments.
